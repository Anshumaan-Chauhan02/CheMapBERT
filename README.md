## Datasets
### Domain
  * Amazon Product Dataset
        https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/
### Fine tuning 
  * Cosmetic Product

  * Sephora Dataset 
        https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/all-products-available-on-sephora-website
    
## Suggestions:
* Try to use other Faster models (less parameters) - such as DistilBERT and Larger Models - such as RoBERTa
* Introduce more datasets in fine-tuning
